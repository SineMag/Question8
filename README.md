# Question8
My life will change that is guaranteed. 
Data engineers are in demand in most of the world, in not whole. 
They also earn great amounts depending on company, location, and so forth. 
I have always wished to work with big companies not just in South Africa but also around the globe, and the good thing about data engineering is that I can work for an overseas company while I’m somewhere in South Africa (home)! 
However, I do not have plans of relocating outside Africa. 
I would love to give back to communities what I’ve received, the training, skills, knowledge, and everything in-between. 
I would love to share the information with scholars who might be interested in the field, let them know how many opportunities are out there waiting for them after Grade 12. 
And I know my family will be famous for being the first to have a data engineer whether in the family or whole town! 
I’m excited! 
I want to help lower the curve of high school learners getting pregnant or involved in drugs. 
Of course, our country will not be clean because of me, but I’m willing to start with the least from my hometown and work my way up. 
Hopefully I’ll be joined by others to teach and be taught, learning never stops! 
I see myself having much more than what I have now. 
Since I’m an introvert, I would like to have my own warm and beautiful home in the suburbs.
